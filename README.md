Using Logistic regression classifier to sentiments Analysis Movies reviews

Title: **IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis**

Description:

Our project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset using machine learning techniques. We leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze text data and classify movie reviews as positive or negative sentiments.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Cleaning:** We preprocess the raw text data by removing special characters, numbers, and stopwords, and perform stemming to normalize the text.

2. **Feature Extraction:** We utilize the Bag of Words approach to convert text data into numerical features, which are then used to train machine learning models.

3. **Classification:** We employ Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm, to train a model that can predict the sentiment of movie reviews.

4. **Model Evaluation:** We evaluate the performance of our model using accuracy metrics on both training and testing datasets to ensure reliable predictions.

5. **Prediction Functionality:** We provide a convenient function to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews using our trained model and Bag of Words vectorizer.

Our project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and understand the sentiment expressed in movie reviews. It can be useful for movie enthusiasts, filmmakers, and analysts interested in understanding audience reactions and preferences.
